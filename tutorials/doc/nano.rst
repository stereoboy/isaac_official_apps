How to Get Started With Jetson Nano
===================================

This section describes how to flash, install wireless connectivity, and run Isaac SDK sample
applications on the Jetson Nano device. To get started with Nano in general, from the very
beginning, see `Getting Started with Jetson Nano Developer Kit <https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit`_.

How to Flash Jetson Nano
------------------------

Nano can be flashed in two ways:

- Via an SD Card: See the procedures in `Getting Started with Jetson Nano Developer Kit <https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit`_.
- Via SDK Manager: See the procedures in `SDK Manager User Guide <https://docs.nvidia.com/sdk-manager>`_

Use those documents to determine the best method for your use case.

Connecting a Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Card
---------------------------------

The Intel 8265 is used for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity. Use the following steps to install
a Wi-Fi/Bluetooth card for Jetson Nano.

1. To accesss the M.2 slot on the carrier board, remove the two screws on the side and open the
   SODIMM latches using both your hands.

2. When the Jetson Nano module pops up, slide it out gently.

3. Take out the Intel wireless card, attach atenna on its U.FL sockets, before inserting the
   card to the M.2 socket. Attaching the antena on the sockets requires a patience and getting
   use to. Use your nail to gently apply a force. You don't need that much force to clamp that
   in once you are in the right position.

4. Slide the Intel 8265 card into the socket.

5. Fix the Intel 8265 card in place with a screw, and replace the Jeston Nano moddule. Make
   sure to use the correct screws in each case.

Getting the IP Address
----------------------

Obtain the IP address of Jetson Nano with the following steps:

1. If necessary, connect a keyboard, mouse, and display, and boot the device as shown in the `Setup and First Boot <https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit#setup>`_ section of `Getting Started with Jetson Nano Developer Kit`.

2. At a terminal prompt, enter the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      bob@jetson:~/$ ip addr show


Sample Applications to Run on Jetson Nano
-----------------------------------------

This section describes the steps to run two sample applications on Jetson Nano. The first does not
require any peripherals. The second one is a more useful application that requires a camera to be
connected.

Other applications can be also deployed and run using the methods described here.

Ping
^^^^

1. On the host system where the Isaac SDK is installed, start by typing the following on your host
   machine with Isaac SDK.

  .. code-block:: bash

     bob@desktop:~/isaac$ /engine/build/deploy.sh -d jetpack42 -h <nano_ip> -p //apps/tutorials/ping:ping-pkg

  You might need to use the `--remote-user USER` flag if the user name on the robot is not `nvidia`.

2. Change to the directory on your Jetson Nano and run the application with the following commands:

  .. code-block:: bash

    bob@jetson:~/$ cd deploy/bob/ping-pkg/
    bob@jetson:~/deploy/bob/ping-pkg$ ./apps/tutorials/ping/ping

Where "bob" is your username on the host system. You should see "Hello World!" being printed every 1.5 seconds.

OpenCV Edge Detection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. For this sample, connect a camera to one of the USB ports on the Jetson Nano.

2. On the host system where the Isaac SDK is installed, type the following command:

  .. code-block:: bash

    bob@jetson:~/isaac$ ./engine/build/deploy.sh -d jetpack42 -h <nano_ip> -p //apps/tutorials/opencv_edge_detection:opencv_edge_detection-pkg

  You might need to use the `--remote-user USER` flag if the user name on the robot is not `nvidia`.

3. Change to the directory on your Jetson Nano and run the application with the following commands:

  .. code-block:: bash

    bob@jetson:~/$ cd deploy/bob/opencv_edge_detection-pkg/
    bob@jetson:~/deploy/bob/opencv_edge_detection-pkg/$ ./apps/tutorials/opencv_edge_detection/opencv_edge_detection

4. To view the results, load :samp:`http://<nano_ip>:3000/` in your browser. Make sure that the
   application is running when you are loading the webpage.
